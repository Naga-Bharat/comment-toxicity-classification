# comment-toxicity-classification






This project aims to foster healthier online interactions by addressing the challenge of multi-label classification of toxic comments.




Prerequisites

To set up this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:



scikit-learn: For various machine learning tools.

scipy: Required for scientific computing and technical computing.

numpy: Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

pandas: Provides data structures and data analysis tools.

scikit-multilearn: Offers support for multi-label classification.

keras: Facilitates neural networks and deep learning.

tensorflow: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.

stop_words: Assists in handling common stop words.

matplotlib: Enables plotting and visualization in Python.

nltk: Needed for natural language processing tasks.




Dataset

The dataset required for training and testing can be downloaded from Kaggle through the following link:
Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge



Additional Setup for NLTK

For using NLTK, you'll need to download the 'wordnet' dataset. Run the following command after installing the nltk package:
nltk.download('wordnet')
